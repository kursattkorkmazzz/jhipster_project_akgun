## Daily Report

**04.08.2023 - Friday**

I learned fundamentals by reading its documentation at [jhipster.tech](jhipster.tech)
I tried to install JHipster and generate the project but I got many errors and tried to solve them.

**05.08.2023 - Saturday**

I solved the all errors and create and project succesfully. 
I tried to understand project structure in Java language.
I got that, I need to learn **JDL and JDL-Studio** to create Entity and relatonship between them. In the backend, JHipster takes care of creating database, authentication and other stuff. 
So, I tried to learn the JDL and how works it. Finally, I saw that all things are related about Spring which is Java framework.  I need to learn Spring framework but this whould take so many times so I decided that I just learn these: **Spring JPA, Spring Security, Spring REST.**

**06.08.2023 - Sunday**
I tried to analyze the code structure. 
Also, I tried to learn what I encounter in analyzing that I don't know.
I watched videos and tried to connect H2 Database in project.
In this day, I learned that I can generate just back-end code. So, I regenerate my project with just back-end code.

**07.08.2023 - Monday**

Because started to understand JDL, Spring REST and Spring JPA and relationship between them, I started to build my REST API back-end code.
Firstly, build an JDL structure bu using JDL-Studio. 
Secondly, import this jdl structure to my project by using `jhipster jdl` command. 
Then, I connected to my database and import my mockup data.
Lastly, I started to prepare my Rest Controller. 
But at the end, I need to write some custom repository functions. So, I had to learn how write my custom repository class.

**08.08.2023 - Tuesday**  
I started to finish all job except these:

1- I need to write my custom repository.

2- I got some errors. I need so solve them.

3- I just need to do some tweaks on  my rest controller classes. 

4- I couldn't finished my filter feature.

I learned how i can write my custom repository class by reading documentation of Spring JPA.
By learning this, I done my tweaks on controllers. Also, finished filter feature.
I got some error. By examining codebase, I tried to solve. And I solve it.
